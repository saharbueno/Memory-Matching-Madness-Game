## Description 

A Pokemon themed memory game where the user must match all the Pokemon pairs to complete the game. There are also three difficulty levels that the user can play through. This game saves highscores to the player's local storage so they can always remember their top scores for each game mode. This was built using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

## Takeaways

The most difficult part of implementing the logic in this game was controlling when the Pokeballs would flip back when the user did not find the correct pair. Something useful that I learned was how to control local storage and save important information in the user's browser. I enjoy coming back to the page every once in a while, playing the game, and seeing my old highscores.
